# digital_collections

This project is written in Django and is part of a larger project at the Hatcher Graduate Library's Digital Projects studio at the University of Michigan. We aim to help scholars and researchers digitize their work so it can reach a larger audience. This project was done as an example for researchers to imagine how we might be able to help them sustainably digitize their work.
